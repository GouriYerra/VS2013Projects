<h1>The Stanford Portable Library for C++</h1>
<p>This package contains a fork of the code for the Stanford Portable C++ library,
as described in the <a href="doc/PortableGraphicsLibrary.pdf">paper</a>
by Eric Roberts and Keith Schwarz included in the
<a href="doc/index.html"><code>doc</code></a> directory.
You can download the source code for the library by clicking on the
following link: <a href="cpplib.zip"><code>cpplib.zip</code></a>.

<p>This fork of the code has been modified by Christopher Painter-Wakefield in
several ways, mainly with the purpose of bringing the library more in line with
the C++ 11 standard.  Specifically, the following changes have been made:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>foreach</code> macro and all uses of it have been removed in
favor of C++ 11 range-based <code>for</code> loops.</li>
<li>Most collections (Vector, Set, HashSet, Map, HashMap) now support C++ 11 
initializer lists.  E.g, the following code is now correct using the library:
<pre>
    Vector&lt;int&gt; v = {1, 2, 3, 4};
</pre>
and also
<pre>
    Map&lt;string, int&gt; m;
    m = {{"apple", 5}, {"orange", 6}, {"pear", 4}};
</pre>
</li>
<li>Several collections (Vector, Set, HashSet) now provide constructors 
taking in first, last iterators in order to easily convert one collection 
to another.</li>
<li>The <code>Thread</code> class and supporting functionality have been 
removed.  This was done in order to simplify the maintenance of the Windows
port of the code.</li>
<li>Various small bugfixes and fixes to the documentation have been made.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <code>Makefile</code> in the root directory should make a complete
version of the library on Unix-based systems or Mac OS X.
Building the <code>.lib</code> file for Windows-based systems depends on
what version of the operating system and what programming environment
you are using.
The sources included in this package should compile in any standard C++
environment, but you will need to create the necessary projects on your
own.
The <a href="spl.zip"><code>spl.jar</code></a> file in the
<code>java</code> directory should work on any platform that supports
Java 6 or any more recent version.
